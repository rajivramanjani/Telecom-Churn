# Telecom-Churn
The azure component of this project is here: https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Experiment/Telecom-Churn-Project 
The kaggle source data is here: https://www.kaggle.com/wisdomgl/churn/data
In this git repository I have placed the wrangled Test and Train data as TeleTest.csv and TeleTrain.csv.  For the raw data you can go to the kaggle repository. 
I initiatlly did this project on Azure and then switched over to redo this project on Python.  As always on Python the results were better.  I think on Python I almost had overfitting with scores of 1.0.  Still the validation dataset had errors despite overfitting.
